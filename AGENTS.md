# Project AI Agent Instructions

This file is the entry point for AI agents working in this repository. It is
**user-owned** — `wmill` never overwrites it. Add your project-specific
guidance below the include line.

The line below pulls in Windmill's managed CLI guidance (skills, deploy flow,
debugging jobs, etc.). Refresh it with `wmill refresh prompts`. Remove the
include line if you don't want the managed guidance in this project.

## Project-specific instructions

Deploy mode: wmill sync push (no CI wiring detected).

<!-- Add anything specific to this repo here. Examples:
     - Deploy commands or environments unique to this project.
     - Domain glossary, naming conventions, or "ask before X" rules.
     - Overrides for the managed guidance above (be explicit that they
       supersede the managed rule). -->

<!-- convex-ai-start -->

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.

# DOX framework

- DOX is highly performant AGENTS.md hierarchy installed here
- Agent must follow DOX instructions across any edits

## Core Contract

- AGENTS.md files are binding work contracts for their subtrees
- Work products, source materials, instructions, records, assets, and durable docs must stay understandable from the nearest applicable AGENTS.md plus every parent AGENTS.md above it

## Read Before Editing

1. Read the root AGENTS.md
2. Identify every file or folder you expect to touch
3. Walk from the repository root to each target path
4. Read every AGENTS.md found along each route
5. If a parent AGENTS.md lists a child AGENTS.md whose scope contains the path, read that child and continue from there
6. Use the nearest AGENTS.md as the local contract and parent docs for repo-wide rules
7. If docs conflict, the closer doc controls local work details, but no child doc may weaken DOX

Do not rely on memory. Re-read the applicable DOX chain in the current session before editing.

## Update After Editing

Every meaningful change requires a DOX pass before the task is done.

Update the closest owning AGENTS.md when a change affects:

- purpose, scope, ownership, or responsibilities
- durable structure, contracts, workflows, or operating rules
- required inputs, outputs, permissions, constraints, side effects, or artifacts
- user preferences about behavior, communication, process, organization, or quality
- AGENTS.md creation, deletion, move, rename, or index contents

Update parent docs when parent-level structure, ownership, workflow, or child index changes. Update child docs when parent changes alter local rules. Remove stale or contradictory text immediately. Small edits that do not change behavior or contracts may leave docs unchanged, but the DOX pass still must happen.

## Hierarchy

- Root AGENTS.md is the DOX rail: project-wide instructions, global preferences, durable workflow rules, and the top-level Child DOX Index
- Child AGENTS.md files own domain-specific instructions and their own Child DOX Index
- Each parent explains what its direct children cover and what stays owned by the parent
- The closer a doc is to the work, the more specific and practical it must be

## Child Doc Shape

- Create a child AGENTS.md when a folder becomes a durable boundary with its own purpose, rules, responsibilities, workflow, materials, or quality standards
- Work Guidance must reflect the current standards of the project or user instructions; if there are no specific standards or instructions yet, leave it empty
- Verification must reflect an existing check; if no verification framework exists yet, leave it empty and update it when one exists

Default section order:
- Purpose
- Ownership
- Local Contracts
- Work Guidance
- Verification
- Child DOX Index

## Style

- Keep docs concise, current, and operational
- Document stable contracts, not diary entries
- Put broad rules in parent docs and concrete details in child docs
- Prefer direct bullets with explicit names
- Do not duplicate rules across many files unless each scope needs a local version
- Delete stale notes instead of explaining history
- Trim obvious statements, repeated rules, misplaced detail, and warnings for risks that no longer exist

## Closeout

1. Re-check changed paths against the DOX chain
2. Update nearest owning docs and any affected parents or children
3. Refresh every affected Child DOX Index
4. Remove stale or contradictory text
5. Run existing verification when relevant
6. Report any docs intentionally left unchanged and why

## User Preferences

When the user requests a durable behavior change, record it here or in the relevant child AGENTS.md

## Child DOX Index

- `src/mastra/` -> `src/mastra/AGENTS.md`: Root Mastra server, agent registration, tool wiring, and chat API surface.
- `convex/` -> `convex/AGENTS.md`: Convex backend rules, generated API surface, and Convex-specific operating constraints.
- `insightful-property-hub/` -> `insightful-property-hub/AGENTS.md`: Main TanStack Start frontend served by the root `dev:web` workflow.
- `megatrend/` -> `megatrend/AGENTS.md`: Secondary standalone TanStack Start app with its own source tree and tooling.

Root-owned without a child AGENTS.md:
- `f/`: Windmill scripts, flows, folder metadata, and deployed automation assets.
- `scripts/`: Runtime wrapper scripts such as `mastra-openrouter.mjs`.
- Root manifests and workspace config: `package.json`, `wmill.yaml`, `tsconfig*.json`, lockfiles, env files, `.wmill-config/`.
- Tooling metadata and caches: `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `.mastra/`, `.mastra-temp/`, `.pnpm-store/`, `node_modules/`, and other generated runtime outputs.
